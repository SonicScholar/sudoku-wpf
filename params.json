{"name":"sudoku-wpf","tagline":"","body":"### Sudoku WPF\r\nA simple .NET/C# command line app that can solve Sudoku puzzles. (Working on making a WPF GUI)\r\n\r\nI made an engine that solves sudoku puzzles. Very rudimentary. However, I believe it can solve all Sudoku puzzles that can be solved without making a guess. I haven't put any \"guess\" algorithms in\r\n\r\n### Collaborators Welcome!\r\nThis is really a hobby project in an attempt to familiarize with .NET and WPF. Sharing expertise via collaboration is more than welcome with this project\r\n\r\n### Next steps/Feature Ideas - help welcome!\r\n- Display SudokuBoard object in some kind of WPF Grid\r\n- Add the ability for a human to change values\r\n- show cell candidates in empty cells\r\n- show \"hints\" on cells that have candidates that can be removed, and which algorithm gives the hint\r\n- Improve csv format of sudoku puzzles\r\n- Add a puzzle generator to the Sudoku Engine\r\n\r\n### Documentation = Very No\r\nIt would be nice to have this project be a tutorial of sorts, so there may be some nice documentation in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n(@ctewalt)\r\nPage last updated on April 8, 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
